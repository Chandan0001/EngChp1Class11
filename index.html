        <h4>Question 2: Three reasons why the author’s grandmother was disturbed when he started going to the city
            school.</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <P> The three reasons why the grandmother of the author was disturbed when he went to the city school are: </P>

        <p>1. She did not like Western learning and Science.</p>

        <p> 2. She was hurt when she came to know that there were no scriptures and teachings of God there. </p>

        <p> 3. She did not like music and thought that it was not for gentlefolk and decent people. In her opinion, it
            was the monopoly of beggars and prostitutes. </p>

<!---Question 3 -->

<h4>Question 3: 3. Three ways in 
    which the author’s grandmother spent her days after he grew up.</h4>
<br>
<h5>Ans:</h5>

<p>Three ways how the grandmother of the author spent her days after he grew up are:

</p>
<p>1. She accepted the loneliness and lived unaccompanied in the room.

</p>
<p>2. She would recite prayers while sitting at the spinning wheel.

</p>
<p>3. She fed the sparrows for half an hour every afternoon.

</p>
<!---Question 4 -->

<h4>Question 4: The odd way in which the author’s grandmother behaved just before she died. 

</h4>
<br>
<h5>Ans:</h5>
<p>The grandmother of the author did not speak to them before her death. The night before she died, she did not pray while singing homecoming songs and beating the drum, as she was not ready to waste time. She laid peacefully in her bed praying and telling beads and ignored the protests of her family members.
