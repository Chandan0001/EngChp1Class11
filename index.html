        <h2 id="scrollspyHeading3" style="margin-top: 90px;">A Photograph </h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Question1: What does the word ‘cardboard’ denote in the poem? Why has this word been used? 
        </h4>
        <br>

        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>In the poem, the word ‘cardboard’ indicates the photograph which is glued on a paper that is hard and thick. It has been used to describe the old practices when the photographs were glued on cardboard and framed with glass in front in order to preserve them.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>Question2: What has the camera captured? 
        </h4>

        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>The camera has captured three girls – the mother of the poet and her two cousins, Dolly and Betty, in their swimming dress on either side of the poet’s mother holding her hands and walking with feet in sea water.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4>Question3: What has not changed over the years? Does this suggest something to you? </h4>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>Over the years, the sea has not changed. Its waves are tireless, shining and fresh as they were in the old days. The changes that occur in a human face with growing age is reminded by the changelessness of the sea.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Question4: The poet’s mother laughed at the snapshot. What did this laugh indicate? </h4>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>This laugh indicates her joy at remembering the incident that connected with her past life, when she was young and free from worries and tensions of life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Question5: What is the meaning of the line “Both wry with the laboured ease of loss.” </h4>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>The poem evokes a sense of loss connected to two cherished memories: the poet's mother's laughter and a past seaside vacation. While both hold amusement, a bittersweet undertone lingers. The relaxed or comfortable feelings associated with them seem forced or unnatural, highlighting the pain of loss. This is further emphasized by the oxymoron "laboured ease," which combines "laboured" (difficult or forced) with "ease" (relaxation) to capture the struggle to recapture a carefree past.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Question6: What does “this circumstance” refer to? </h4>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>“This circumstance” refers to the death of the poet’s mother.        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Question7: The three stanzas depict three different phases. What are they?
        </h4>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>1. Girlhood of the poet’s mother – The phase before the poet’s birth.
        </p>
        <p>2. Middle age – The phase during the poet’s childhood.
        </p>
        <p>3. Death – The phase after the death of the poet’s mother.

        <h4>Question 1: The three phases of the author’s relationship with his grandmother before he left the country to
            study abroad.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>The three phases of the relationship of the author with his grandmother before leaving the country to study
            abroad are:

        </p>
        <p>(i) Early childhood – His grandmother helped him while getting ready and went to the village school along
            with him.

        </p>

        <p>(ii) Boyhood – He shared a room with his grandmother when he studied at the city school. She was not able to
            help him in his studies.

        </p>

        <p>(iii) Early youth – The link of their friendship snapped when he was provided a separate room at the
            university.

        </p>
        <br>
        <!---Question2 -->
        <h4>Question 2: Three reasons why the author’s grandmother was disturbed when he started going to the city
            school.</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <P> The three reasons why the grandmother of the author was disturbed when he went to the city school are: </P>

        <p>1. She did not like Western learning and Science.</p>

        <p> 2. She was hurt when she came to know that there were no scriptures and teachings of God there. </p>

        <p> 3. She did not like music and thought that it was not for gentlefolk and decent people. In her opinion, it
            was the monopoly of beggars and prostitutes. </p>

<!---Question 3 -->

<h4>Question 3: Three ways in 
    which the author’s grandmother spent her days after he grew up.</h4>
<br>
<h5>Ans:</h5>

<p>Three ways how the grandmother of the author spent her days after he grew up are:

</p>
<p>1. She accepted the loneliness and lived unaccompanied in the room.

</p>
<p>2. She would recite prayers while sitting at the spinning wheel.

</p>
<p>3. She fed the sparrows for half an hour every afternoon.

</p>
<!---Question 4 -->

<h4>Question 4: The odd way in which the author’s grandmother behaved just before she died. 

</h4>
<br>
<h5>Ans:</h5>
<p>The grandmother of the author did not speak to them before her death. The night before she died, she did not pray while singing homecoming songs and beating the drum, as she was not ready to waste time. She laid peacefully in her bed praying and telling beads and ignored the protests of her family members.

</p>

        <!---Question 5 -->

        <h4>Question 5: The way in
            which the sparrows expressed their sorrow when the author’s grandmother died.</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>The dead body of the author’s grandmother was surrounded by
            thousands of sparrows which did not chirrup (चहचहाना). They did not even notice the bread crumbs (रोटी के छोटे छोटे टुकड़े) which were thrown by
            the author’s mother to feed them. They quietly flew away once
            the corpse of the grandmother was carried away. Hence, this way
            the sparrows expressed their sorrow when the author’s grandmother died.

        <h3>Talking about the text </h3> <br>
        <!---Question 1 -->

        <h4>Question 1: The author’s grandmother was a religious person. What are the
            different ways in which we come to know this?</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>The text reveals the author's grandmother as a
            very religious person in several ways: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <b> Rituals</b>: Every morning, she visited the temple and dedicated time to reading scriptures.</li>
            <li><b>Constant Prayers</b>: Back at home, she would silently mutter prayers and consistently finger the
                beads of her rosary.</li>
            <li><b>Instilling Faith</b>: While helping the author get ready, she would recite prayers in a singsong
                manner, hoping the author would memorize them.</li>
            <li><b>Dislike for Modern Education</b>: She disapproved of the English school because it lacked religious
                teachings about God and scriptures.</li>
            <li><b>Deeply Entrenched Devotion</b>: Even while working at her spinning wheel, she wouldn't neglect her
                prayers. There's a mention of a single instance where she forgot, likely due to excitement about her
                grandson's arrival</li>
            <li><b>Focus in Final Moments</b>: Interestingly, even during the celebratory pre-death event, she turned to
                prayer and continued this practice until her very last breath.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--End question 1-->

        <!---Question 2 -->

        <h4>Question 2: Describe the changing relationship between the author and his
            grandmother. Did their feelings for each other change?</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>The author's relationship with his grandmother changed due to several factors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Increased Independence</b>: Moving to the city and attending school by bus meant less physical
                dependence on his grandmother.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Educational Disparity</b>: The difference in their educational backgrounds made it difficult for her
                to help him with his studies. She also disapproved of the curriculum, particularly the lack of religious
                instruction.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Emotional Distance</b>: These factors led to a growing emotional distance between them. This is
                evident in her silence after the music incident and their separate rooms at university.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Despite these changes, the text emphasizes that their love for each other remained constant. This is shown
            in her presence at the train station to see him off and her joyful celebration upon his return.</p>


        <!--End question 2-->

        <!---Question 3 -->

        <h4>Question 3: Would you agree that the author’s grandmother was a person strong
            in character? If yes, give instances that show this.</h4>
        <br>
        <h5>Ans:</h5>
        <p>Absolutely, the author's grandmother emerges as a strong character throughout the passage. Here are some
            specific instances that highlight her strength:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Unyielding Faith (अटल विश्वास)</b>: Her dedication to her religion is unwavering (अटूट). Daily temple visits, scripture
                reading, constant prayers, and a strong disapproval of the non-religious curriculum all demonstrate her
                deep-rooted beliefs. Even in her final moments, she prioritizes prayer, showcasing the unshakable core
                of her character.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Traditional Values</b>: She holds firm to her traditional way of life. The discomfort with the
                "western lifestyle" and the English/Science education system indicates her commitment to her established
                values.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Resolute in her Disapproval</b>: Her disapproval of music education is another example of her
                unwavering stance. She doesn't shy away from expressing her convictions, even if it creates distance
                with others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Strength in Adversity</b>: Despite her age and potential physical limitations, her mental resolve
                remains strong. This is evident in her act of feeding sparrows in the city, demonstrating her continued
                care and action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prioritizing Faith over Friendliness</b>: Refusing to speak with family before her death showcases a
                remarkable prioritization of her faith. This act, while seemingly harsh, reveals the unwavering strength
                of her convictions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In conclusion, the author's grandmother's unwavering faith, traditional values, resolute disapproval, strength
        in potential adversity, and prioritization of faith all paint a picture of a strong character who holds true to
        her beliefs.

        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Essay On Swamy Vivekananda's life</h4>
        <p>Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta in 1863, was more than just a monk; he was a bridge between the ancient wisdom of India and the modern world. His life and teachings continue to inspire generations, making him a pivotal figure in shaping India's image on the global stage.
</p>
<p>
            Vivekananda's intellectual curiosity and questioning nature led him to grapple with the existence of God and the purpose of life. His search took him to Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, a mystic who became his guru and opened the doors to spiritual experience. Under Ramakrishna's tutelage, Vivekananda explored various spiritual paths – Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity – developing a universal philosophy that emphasized the oneness of all religions.
        </p>
        <p>         
            In 1893, Vivekananda's life took a momentous turn when he represented Hinduism at the Parliament of World's Religions in Chicago. His iconic speech, beginning with the now-famous words "Sisters and Brothers of America," captivated the audience. He presented Hinduism not as a rigid dogma, but as a vibrant and universal religion with a rich philosophical tradition. This catapulted him into the limelight, making him a global ambassador of Hinduism and Indian culture.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Vivekananda's teachings were not confined to the realm of spirituality. He believed in the inherent strength and potential of every human being. His concept of "Atman" (the eternal Self) emphasized the divinity within each individual. He advocated for social reform, urging the youth of India to rise above poverty and ignorance through education and service. The message of "Daridra Narayana Seva" (service to the poor as God) became the cornerstone of his social mission.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Vivekananda's legacy lives on through the Ramakrishna Mission, a monastic order established by him. The Mission works tirelessly in education, healthcare, and social welfare, carrying forward his ideals of selfless service. His writings, including "Raja Yoga" and "Jnana Yoga," continue to be seminal works on yoga, philosophy, and spirituality.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In conclusion, Swami Vivekananda was more than just a religious leader. He was a philosopher, social reformer, and a powerful motivator who awakened a sense of national pride in India. His message of universal brotherhood, self-reliance, and service to humanity transcends geographical and temporal boundaries, offering timeless wisdom for the 21st century. Even today, his call to awaken the potential within each of us serves as a guiding light for individuals and societies seeking progress and spiritual fulfillment.
